# Live Browser

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `subtext:shared` for MCP conventions and sightmap upload.
> **ENVIRONMENT:** If a `subtext-environment` skill is available in the host project, read it before connecting — it specifies which MCP server prefix to use for live tools.

API catalog for live browser tools (all prefixed `live-`) on the unified subtext MCP server. These tools let you open browser connections, navigate views, interact with elements, and inspect console/network activity.

## MCP Tools

### Connections

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `live-connect` | Open a browser connection to a URL. Returns screenshot, component tree, `fs_session_url`, `viewer_url`, and `capture_status`. |
| `live-disconnect` | Close a browser connection. Returns `fs_session_url` and `viewer_url`. |
| `live-emulate` | Set device emulation (viewport, user agent, etc.) |

### Views

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `live-view-navigate` | Navigate the current view to a new URL |
| `live-view-new` | Open a new view (tab) |
| `live-view-list` | List all open views |
| `live-view-select` | Switch to a different view |
| `live-view-close` | Close a view |
| `live-view-snapshot` | Component tree snapshot (no screenshot) |
| `live-view-inspect` | Component tree with full CSS selectors — for sightmap authoring only, not general use |
| `live-view-screenshot` | Visual screenshot of current view |
| `live-view-resize` | Resize the viewport |

### Interactions

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `live-act-click` | Click an element by UID |
| `live-act-hover` | Hover over an element |
| `live-act-fill` | Fill a text input |
| `live-act-keypress` | Press a key or key combination |
| `live-act-drag` | Drag from one element to another |
| `live-act-wait-for` | Wait for a condition (selector, navigation, timeout) |
| `live-act-dialog` | Accept or dismiss a browser dialog |
| `live-act-upload` | Upload a file to a file input |

### Developer Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `live-eval-script` | Run JavaScript in the page context |
| `live-log-list` | List console messages |
| `live-log-get` | Get details of a specific console message |
| `live-net-list` | List network requests |
| `live-net-get` | Get details of a specific network request |

### Tunnel

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `live-tunnel` | Get tunnel relay URL for connecting to localhost |

## Discovering Parameters

Parameter schemas are visible in the tool definition at call time.

## Session URLs

Both `fs_session_url` and `viewer_url` are returned by `live-connect`, `live-disconnect`, `live-view-navigate`, `live-view-new`, and `live-view-snapshot`.

- **fs_session_url** — the raw Fullstory session URL.
- **viewer_url** — a shareable link that opens the live viewer in a browser. **Always print this to the user** so they can watch the agent's browser in real time.

After every connection is established — via `live-connect` or `live-view-new` (tunnel-first flow) — output the viewer URL on its own line:

```
Viewer: {viewer_url}
```

## Capture Status

Every live tool response that touches a view includes a `capture_status` field —
this includes `live-connect`, `live-view-new`, `live-view-navigate`,
`live-view-snapshot`, and `live-view-screenshot`. Check it after **every** such
call (not just `live-connect`) and respond as follows:

- `active`: proceed normally.
- `blocked`: tell the user to check capture quota and verify the target domain is allow listed in Subtext data capture settings.
- `snippet_not_found` or `api_unavailable`: tell the user something went wrong during setup and they should run onboarding again.
- any other status: something went wrong, try again

This matters especially in the **tunnel-first flow**, where `live-connect` is
never called — it's easy to miss the status if you assume the check only applies
to that one tool.

## Tips

- Always `live-view-snapshot` before interacting — you need element UIDs to click/fill.
- `live-view-snapshot` is cheaper than `live-view-screenshot`. Prefer snapshots; use screenshots for visual evidence.
- `live-view-inspect` is for **sightmap authoring only** — it returns verbose CSS selectors on every node. Do not use it as a general snapshot replacement. Use it once to discover selectors, write your `.sightmap/` YAML, then use `live-view-snapshot` for everything else.
- Component names from sightmap appear in snapshots — use `[src: ...]` annotations to find source files.
- Close connections when done to free server resources.

## Tunnel Setup

When the hosted browser needs to reach `localhost` or local dev URLs, use the tunnel-first flow:

1. Call `live-tunnel` — allocates a browser connection and returns `relayUrl` + `connectionId`
2. Call `tunnel-connect` on the **subtext-tunnel** MCP server with `relayUrl` and `target`
3. Call `live-view-new` with the `connection_id` and localhost URL

Do **not** use `live-connect` for localhost URLs — it mints its own connection ID and can't bind to the tunnel. See `subtext:tunnel` for full details.
