# Session Replay

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `subtext:shared` for MCP conventions and sightmap upload.

API catalog for the session replay tools (all prefixed `review-`). These tools let you open sessions, inspect UI state at specific timestamps, and compare state across time.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `review-open` | Open a session for analysis. Returns event summaries, metadata, timestamps. |
| `review-view` | Capture UI state at a timestamp — component tree + screenshot |
| `review-inspect` | Component tree with full CSS selectors — for sightmap authoring only, not general use |
| `review-diff` | Compare UI state between two timestamps |
| `review-close` | Close the session and free resources |

## Discovering Parameters

Parameter schemas are visible in the tool definition at call time.

## Session Input

Pass the full `session_url` directly to `review-open` when a URL is provided. If the URL fails, parse it to extract `device_id` and `session_id` and pass those instead.

When no session URL or IDs are available, you can look up a user's most recent session by passing `email_address` or `user_uid`. Precedence: `session_url` > `device_id`+`session_id` > `email_address` > `user_uid`.

## Tips

- Event summaries from `review-open` are cheap. `review-view` is expensive. Start with summaries.
- `review-diff` between before/after is the most revealing tool — it shows exactly what changed.
- Console errors and network failures in event summaries are highest-signal starting points.
- Component names in `review-view`/`review-diff` output include `[src: ...]` annotations — use these to find source files directly.
- Always close sessions when done to free server resources.
